"""
JARVIS plugin — 3D Printer Control (Phase 1).

Voice control for any Bambu Lab printer (and, later, Creality/Klipper) over the
local network: ask for status, pause / resume / stop the print, toggle the
chamber light, or have JARVIS proactively tell you when a print finishes or fails.

This plugin is for EVERYONE, not one machine — it holds no printer-specific
values. Connection details (brand, IP, access code, serial) are entered by each
user in the ⚙ plugin-settings tab and read back through plugins._printer_core.
Spoken return strings are English on purpose: JARVIS re-speaks them in the
user's own language (project rule).

Requires:  pip install paho-mqtt   (only needed to actually reach a Bambu; the
plugin still loads and explains this if the package is missing).
