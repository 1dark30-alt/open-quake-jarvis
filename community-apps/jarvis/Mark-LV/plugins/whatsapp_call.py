"""
JARVIS plugin — WhatsApp voice & video calling.

`send_message` can already open WhatsApp and find a person. What it cannot do
is the thing you actually want half the time: *ring* them. This plugin finishes
that journey — "call Yusuf on WhatsApp", "görüntülü ara Yusuf'u", "video call
mum" — and hangs up again when you ask.

NEEDS  _whatsapp_core.py  NEXT TO IT
    The driver — finding WhatsApp, opening a conversation, reading back who is
    on screen, pressing the control — lives in that shared file, because the
    incoming-call plugin needs exactly the same driver. Download both.

THREE SYSTEMS, ONE BEHAVIOUR
    The core offers three ways to reach WhatsApp and this plugin does not care
    which one it gets:

      Windows   the desktop app, through UI Automation
      macOS     the desktop app, through the Accessibility API (beta)
      Linux     WhatsApp Web in a Playwright-driven browser — there is no
                official WhatsApp desktop client for Linux at all

    ⚙ → WHATSAPP → Transport is 'auto' by default, which prefers the desktop
    app because that is what most people run and a call placed there rings in
    the real application on the real audio devices. Set it to 'web' and every
    system uses the browser instead.

IT PRESSES THE CONTROL, NOT A PIXEL
    On every transport the call button is *invoked* — Invoke on Windows, AXPress
    on macOS, a click on the element's own reported rectangle on the web. No
    cursor offsets, no DPI arithmetic, nothing that breaks when the window moves
    to a second monitor or is partly covered.

IT CHECKS WHO IT IS ABOUT TO RING
    This is the difference between a convenience and an embarrassment. After
    searching, it reads back *who is actually on screen* and compares it with
    who you asked for. A mismatch does not dial — it returns a question, and
    only calls once you have agreed.

    A wrong tap sends a real phone call to a real person. Refusing to guess is
    the whole point.

FOR EVERY LANGUAGE
    There is not one hardcoded UI string on the critical path. The call buttons
    are found by name across ~20 languages, and when the name is unfamiliar the
    plugin falls back to *layout*: the conversation title is by far the widest
    element in the header band, and the action buttons sit to the right of it in
    a fixed order. Contact names are typed through the clipboard, which is the
    only way ş, ü, я and 漢 survive.
